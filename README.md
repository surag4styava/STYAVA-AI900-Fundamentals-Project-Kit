Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900) Masterclass: Structured notes, cheat sheets, and the Azure security IaC challenge blueprint.
STYAVA-AI900-Fundamentals-Project-KitThe AI-900 Deconstructed: Core Concepts, Battle Plan, and Code ChallengesThis repository provides the structured notes, essential cheat sheets, and security blueprint from the STYAVA 2-Day Azure AI Fundamentals Masterclass. We are turning conceptual knowledge into deployable skills.🧭 I. The AI Services Map (System Thinking)The AI-900 is about knowing the right tool for the job. Our Masterclass defined the five pillars of Azure AI:Insert the link to your visual diagram here (after you create the image).**Key Service Distinctions (The Expert View)AI WorkloadPrimary Azure ToolCore FunctionalityThe STYAVA TakeawayMachine LearningAzure Machine LearningPlatform for training custom predictive models (Regression/Classification).[cite_start]Choose AML when: You need custom prediction, model versioning, or complex Python workflows (Notebooks)[cite: 1441, 1442, 1443, 1444].Custom VisionCustom Vision ServiceTraining a model on your own images to detect specific, custom objects (e.g., dog breed, custom meter type).The Problem Solver: You must use this when Computer Vision's pre-trained generic model fails.Forms/DocumentForms Recognizer (Applied AI)Extracts data from structured documents (receipts, invoices, passports).Applied AI: These services solve one problem very well, requiring less development effort.🛠️ II. The Project Kit Challenge (Bridging the Code Gap)Since the session did not include live IaC code, this challenge forces you to build the solution discussed by the expert.1. Starter Assets (In /starters/ folder):config_checklist.md: Contains the exact configuration checklist and design choices mentioned for secure environment deployment (e.g., network segmentation, load balancing choices).vnet_starter.bicep: A minimal Bicep template to deploy a basic VNet and a single subnet—the necessary foundation for the challenge.2. The Security IaC Challenge (Project 3: Enterprise Integration):Your Task: Complete the following using Bicep (Infrastructure as Code):Take the vnet_starter.bicep file.Add an Azure OpenAI Service resource.Add a Private Endpoint resource linked to the Azure OpenAI Service.Verify that your configuration ensures traffic to the AI service never touches the public internet, achieving the Privacy & Security principle.🔗 III.
